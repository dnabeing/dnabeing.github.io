Welcome to a blog about what it's like being an engineering student. From the lows of not getting accepted to certain colleges to the highs of getting multiple internship offers, this blog covers (or will cover) subjects that many high schoolers, parents, and college students seek to understand more.

I'm a second-year undergrad studying aerospace engineering and computer programming. When I was in high school, my parents didn't know what the SATs were, so I had to mostly figure out the college admission process on my own. I navigated through these challenging times by asking for help or looking for it on the internet. That's where I hope to serve you, as a college mentor with first-hand experience in the 21st century.

This blog is made up of two main sections: posts and DAILY posts.

Expect to see a new post once a month. The daily posts, on the other hand, are posted more regularly (not quite daily, but with enough recurrences).

If you are interested in this blog and find it useful, feel free to bookmark the home page, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dnabeing), and share.

Best of luck on your college journey!
