### Respect through Conversations

Most of our days will probably be dull, marked by sudden thrills and moments of sadness.

Consider the conversations you have throughout the day. Of course, context matters. But a main thread applies: your engagement.

Listening intently, asking questions, seeking to understand. These traits come few and far between. Granted, it's not always easy, nor do we always feel the need to execute such attentiveness.

Regardless, people notice how you attend to conversations. The choice is yours.
